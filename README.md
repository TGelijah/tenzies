## Easter Egg
Not really an easter egg I guess 🤷🏿‍♂️ since hovering on it will inform you of the implemented functionality 🤣.
P.S it is not the best implementation of that functionality but I tried to make the best out of it lol. if you find it you can let me know [via my twitter handle](twitter.com/sladowham) you can also share with your friends if you enjoy this implementation of the game.

## Current Features
